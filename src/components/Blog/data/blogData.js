    title: "The Future of 3D Web Experiences",
    content: "Just finished working on my new 3D portfolio site! 🚀 Using React Three Fiber was a challenge but totally worth it. The web is moving towards more immersive experiences, and as developers, we need to adapt. \n\nIn this project, I explored how to optimize 3D models for the web, manage state with Zustand, and create smooth animations using GSAP. The result is a seamless journey through a digital universe. \n\nCheck out the space theme and let me know your thoughts! #webdev #react #threejs #portfolio",

    title: "Custom PCB Design Journey",
    content: "Exploring the beauty of electronics. 🔌 Creating a custom PCB for my home automation project has been an incredible journey. From schematic design to the final soldering process, every step teaches you something new. \n\nI used EasyEDA for the design and JLCPCB for manufacturing. The board integrates an ESP32 for WiFi connectivity and controls 4 relays. Can't wait to install this in my smart home system! #electronics #arduino #iot #pcbdesign",

    content: "A small sketch from my free time. ✏️ Art is the best way to relax after a long coding session. Sometimes, stepping away from the screen and using a stylus or pencil helps rejuvenate creativity. \n\nThis piece was inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics and neon cityscapes. Tools used: Procreate on iPad Pro. #art #sketch #creative #digitalart",
